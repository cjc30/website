        <h1>Polyhedra - <b>Temporary outage</b></h1>
        <p>Due to a copyright request by representatives of W Type Foundary, the font <b>Friends</b> (also known as the Melbourne Airport font) has been removed.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my laptop with all source code for the site is being repaired, so I can't just update the site without the font, therefore all content will be removed until then.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to contact me on Discord (<b>@polygontransit</b>) or email <b>hello@polyhedra.au</b> to request any PTV Network fonts or any other questions.</p>
